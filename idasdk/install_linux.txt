How to install SDK under Linux or OS X
--------------------------------------

All source files are the same for all platforms and are compiled using the
same makefile. However, since IDA makefiles use Borland format,
we have to preprocess them before passing them to UNIX make.
It is done using the idamake.pl script in the bin subdirectory:

        ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

This script will preprocess the makefile, create a temporary makefile
and launch the GNU make utility on it.

To build for Linux, the following environment variable must be defined:

        export __LINUX__=1 (for Linux)
or      export __MAC__=1   (for OS X)

To create ida64 modules, define the __EA64__ symbol for make. For example:

        __EA64__=1 ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

will compile a modlue for the 64-bit version of IDA.

Please note that ida64 itself is a 32-bit application, so the above line
compiles a 32-bit module that can handle 64-bit applications with idal64.

To create a true 64-bit module, define the __X64__ symbol:

        __X64__=1 ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

This mode of compilation should be used *only* for debugger servers (all
other IDA modules are 32-bit).

Creating an alias for this commands is a good idea. I have the following in my
.bashrc file:

export __LINUX__=1
export PATH=~/idasdk/bin:$PATH
alias m='idamake.pl 2>&1'
alias mm='__EA64__=1 idamake.pl 2>&1'
alias mx='__X64__=1 idamake.pl 2>&1'


Troubleshooting
------------------------------

If you get the error message: "ld: library not found for -lida", you forgot to
copy libida.so/dylib (see "Libraries" section in readme.txt).
